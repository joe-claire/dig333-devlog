## Week 2

### Context

- Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences. Also include...
- 1 quote from the reading(s)
- 1 related comment on the reading(s)
- 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?)

The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World
This reading discusses how the nature of our technological developments is becoming more complex and "smart". The article is calling for consistency and thoughtfulness as well as transparency from developers in this era of rapid technological change. "By creating new procedures, standards, and best practices, we can bring order to the disorder the IoT generates." I liked this quote because of its hopeful outlook on the future. I have friends who have smart speakers or other smart devices in their homes and many of them agree that, while they are designed to make their lives easier, they cause more of a hassle to use than to live without the smart device. While I'm exicted to see where the future of technology leads us, I think we should not get ahead of ourselves by trying to use technology that is not at the level that is worth our time and money to invest in. I wonder where the line is for consumers between cost and benefit for many of these smart products. At what point is the smart product worthwhile?

The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours
This reading has a satirical view of smart technology and the Internet of Things. It also points out many of the risks associated with smart technologies when they fail or become obsolete. "My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didn’t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need." This quote illustrates the idea that smart technology is profiting off of the fact that many consumers opt to buy the new and complicated instead of the old and simple. The picture of the smart trash can in this article reminded me of my grandparent's trash can, which has a flat, battery operated lid that opens and closes when motion is detected. It worked for a month or two but when the batteries ran out, they never got around to replacing them. So they've had a trash can for a few years now that is next to impossible to open because there is no accessible handle on the lid. I'm curious to know more about the advertising possibilities of smart technology, and how obscure data can be translated into specific targeted advertising.


### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->


Experiment 1: Taste the power
    I. A tongue in this experiment is acting as a resistor. Ohms are a unit of measurement used to describe electrical resistance.
    II. Quiz question: What is the symbol for Ohms?
    
Experiment 2: Abuse a battery

Describe Ohm's Law using the water analogy.
    In the water analogy, the pressure in a tank that holds water can be compared to voltage. Current is represented by the water flowing through a pipe connected to the tank. Resistance is how wide the pipe is, which limits how much water can exit the tank.

Understand three differences between DC and AC. 
DC is direct current, and it comes from batteries. It is like the water analogy because it is direct flow from one point to another. AC stands for alternating current because it constantly switches back and forth from positive to negative. AC allows for power to be sent longer distances, which is why it is used in powering homes. DC currents, because they come from batteries, can supply a wide range of volts depending on what type of battery you buy. AC, on the other hand, in the US, has a more standardized supply of 110-120 volts.

Quiz question: What is the purpose of a battery's + and - sides?

Experiment 3: Your First Circuit

This is a picture of our group testing the voltage of a battery pack. We learned that changing which wires are connected to the multimeter will determine if the multimeter provides a positive or negative reading.

In this picture, our group was combining three battery packs in series to burn out an LED. You can see that we are measuring the voltage of multiple battery packs combined, which is why the multimeter is reading higher than if we were measuring just one battery pack. 
Quiz question: What is the importance of having the proper degree of resistance in your circuit?


Experiment 4: Variable Resistance

Polarity is the concept that electricity will flow from one positive point to a negative point. This is why batteries have positive and negative sides. This allows for the current to be sent from one side of the battery to the other via powering a circuit.

Current measurements in a circuit indentify the rate of electricity moving at a point on a circuit. Voltage is the potential force to move electricity through a circuit. 

Ohm's law: voltage = current × resistance

If you know the voltage and current, you can divide voltage by amps to get the resistance.
Example: 12v battery = 4amps x ______
The resistance is 3Ω.
Quiz question: How would the voltage reading change when using a multimeter on a parallel vs series circuit?

Experiment 5: Let's Make a Battery

Volts are the pressure or potential energy in a circuit, the current is the rate of flow in the circuit, and watts are the potential to do work. 1 volt = 1 watt/ 1 amp

When batteries are in parallel, there is a greater total length of time to power the circuit. Putting the batteries in series doubles the voltage but reduces the amount of time that the batteries will power the circuit.

Quiz question: True or false: Batteries in parallel can deliver twice the current in the same amount of time as batteries in series.


## Week 4
Pay for the Printer by Philip K. Dick (1956)
This short story is about a post apocalyptic world where nobody knows how to make things. Aliens have moved in to earth with the capability of copying things for people, which has replaced the need for humans to know how to create. But this alien species is dying and people are running out of options, so they have to return to making things on their own– a foreign challenge to many of them. 
“He indicated the crude wooden cup. ‘That's where we are right now. Don't laugh at it. Don't say it's not civilization. It is -- it's simple and crude, but it's the real thing. We'll go up from here.’”
The premise of civilization collapsing when we learn how to make new things is super interesting to me. It communicates the idea that a core part of humanity is creativity and the ability to make. 
This was a futuristic story at the time it was written, but now to us in 2022 it takes place in the past. How might it be interpreted differently by readers over the years?

The Preserving Machine by Philip K. Dick (1953)
This is another short story by Philip K. Dick. A man wants to preserve sheet music, so he creates a machine that installs sheet music inside different animals, allowing him to later reverse the process to retrieve the music from the animals. But a problem arises– the music is altered in the copying process and is now a gross distorted version of the original. The animals themselves are no longer tame but become violent. The project is deemed a failure.
"Only time will tell," I said. "Even though this method failed, some other may work; something that we can't foresee or predict now may come along, some day."
Both of these stories have examples of people wanting to copy and preserve things, but they resort to machines or other systems instead of doing it themselves. I think part of the goal of these stories is to remind us that our ability to create is unparalleled.
What is the significance of the beetle at the end?

## Week 5

Everything That’s Inside Your iPhone by Brian Merchant (2017)
This article explores the sources of the materials used in iPhones. The author completely disassembled an iPhone for the sake of identifying all of the elements inside of it. They also describe some of the mines that extract these raw materials and the dangerous conditions that are challenging to regulate.
"It makes for a vast web of companies, organizations, and actors; Apple directly purchases few of the raw materials that wind up in its products. That's true of many companies that manufacture smartphones, computers, or complex machinery—most rely on a tangled web of third-party suppliers to produce their stuff, which makes it difficult to draw direct lines from a specific device to a specific mine."
It's interesting to consider that we are taking raw materials in their natural forms and turning them into something very unnatural, which is a challenging process to reverse. This makes it hard to recycle the natural materials used. Meanwhile, Apple markets iPhones like they need to be replaced every year or two, which is a very unsustainable approach.
What are the recycling processes like for iPhones? How much can be repurposed and how much is wasted?

One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch by Rachel Swaby
More components than meet the eye go into even the simplest technology we can purchase from a store. Thomas Thwaites discovered this by disassembling a toaster in hopes of making one for himself from scratch. In the end, he was only partially successful because his version started melting itself.
"The world produces something like 260 million tons of plastic annually, up from 1.5 million tons in 1950."
There are some components (wires, switches, chips, etc) that we view as essential now that are almost treated like raw materials on their own. It means that we can take for granted the creation of these materials themselves. We are used to just buying components on Amazon, but it gets much more challenging when you start building something completely from scratch.
What makes some plastics able to be recycled and not others?
