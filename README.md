## Week 1

### Context

- Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences. Also include...
- 1 quote from the reading(s)
- 1 related comment on the reading(s)
- 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?)

The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World
This reading discusses how the nature of our technological developments is becoming more complex and "smart". The article is calling for consistency and thoughtfulness as well as transparency from developers in this era of rapid technological change. "By creating new procedures, standards, and best practices, we can bring order to the disorder the IoT generates." I liked this quote because of its hopeful outlook on the future. I have friends who have smart speakers or other smart devices in their homes and many of them agree that, while they are designed to make their lives easier, they cause more of a hassle to use than to live without the smart device. While I'm exicted to see where the future of technology leads us, I think we should not get ahead of ourselves by trying to use technology that is not at the level that is worth our time and money to invest in. I wonder where the line is for consumers between cost and benefit for many of these smart products. At what point is the smart product worthwhile?

The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours
This reading has a satirical view of smart technology and the Internet of Things. It also points out many of the risks associated with smart technologies when they fail or become obsolete. "My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didnâ€™t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need." This quote illustrates the idea that smart technology is profiting off of the fact that many consumers opt to buy the new and complicated instead of the old and simple. The picture of the smart trash can in this article reminded me of my grandparent's trash can, which has a flat, battery operated lid that opens and closes when motion is detected. It worked for a month or two but when the batteries ran out, they never got around to replacing them. So they've had a trash can for a few years now that is next to impossible to open because there is no accessible handle on the lid. I'm curious to know more about the advertising possibilities of smart technology, and how obscure data can be translated into specific targeted advertising.
