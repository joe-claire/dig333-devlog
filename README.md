## Week 2

### Context

- Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences. Also include...
- 1 quote from the reading(s)
- 1 related comment on the reading(s)
- 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?)

The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World
This reading discusses how the nature of our technological developments is becoming more complex and "smart". The article is calling for consistency and thoughtfulness as well as transparency from developers in this era of rapid technological change. "By creating new procedures, standards, and best practices, we can bring order to the disorder the IoT generates." I liked this quote because of its hopeful outlook on the future. I have friends who have smart speakers or other smart devices in their homes and many of them agree that, while they are designed to make their lives easier, they cause more of a hassle to use than to live without the smart device. While I'm exicted to see where the future of technology leads us, I think we should not get ahead of ourselves by trying to use technology that is not at the level that is worth our time and money to invest in. I wonder where the line is for consumers between cost and benefit for many of these smart products. At what point is the smart product worthwhile?

The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours
This reading has a satirical view of smart technology and the Internet of Things. It also points out many of the risks associated with smart technologies when they fail or become obsolete. "My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didn’t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need." This quote illustrates the idea that smart technology is profiting off of the fact that many consumers opt to buy the new and complicated instead of the old and simple. The picture of the smart trash can in this article reminded me of my grandparent's trash can, which has a flat, battery operated lid that opens and closes when motion is detected. It worked for a month or two but when the batteries ran out, they never got around to replacing them. So they've had a trash can for a few years now that is next to impossible to open because there is no accessible handle on the lid. I'm curious to know more about the advertising possibilities of smart technology, and how obscure data can be translated into specific targeted advertising.


### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Name of the experiment
    1. Text, photos, etc.
    1. Describe the most important thing you learned (to share in class)
    1. Write a quiz question (which we will discuss in class)




Experiment 1: Taste the power
    I. A tongue in this experiment is acting as a resistor. Ohms are a unit of measurement used to describe electrical resistance.
    II. Quiz question: What is the symbol for Ohms?
Experiment 2: Abuse a battery

Describe Ohm's Law using the water analogy.
    In the water analogy, the pressure in a tank that holds water can be compared to voltage. Current is represented by the water flowing through a pipe connected to the tank. Resistance is how wide the pipe is, which limits how much water can exit the tank.

Understand three differences between DC and AC. 
DC is direct current, and it comes from batteries. It is like the water analogy because it is direct flow from one point to another. AC stands for alternating current because it constantly switches back and forth from positive to negative. AC allows for power to be sent longer distances, which is why it is used in powering homes. DC currents, because they come from batteries, can supply a wide range of volts depending on what type of battery you buy. AC, on the other hand, in the US, has a more standardized supply of 110-120 volts.

Experiment 3: Your First Circuit
Identify a resistor's value using both a color chart and a multimeter
Use a multimeter to check voltage and resistance of components.
Demonstrate a basic circuit with an LED, resistor, battery, and Ohm's Law. 
Collin's Lab: LEDs (5:29), Resistors (5:08), Ohm's Law (7:09)
Experiment 4: Variable Resistance
⚠️ Don't destroy the potentiometer.
Build a circuit that dims an LED with a potentiometer.
Describe polarity in the context of electronics.
Demonstrate how to check voltage across parts of a circuit.
Demonstrate how to measure current in a circuit.
Compare current vs. voltage measurements throughout components in a circuit.
Use Ohm's Law to calculate resistance.
Create circuits using LEDs in both series and parallel. 


Experiment 5: Let's Make a Battery
⚠️ Read this section but don't do the lemon experiment.
Define and describe the relationship between volts, current, and watts.
Explain what happens to voltage, current, and watts (time) when batteries are placed in series vs. in parallel.
